# Emotive Text Analytics

The Emotive Text Analytics Project utilizes machine learning methodologies to discern and interpret emotional patterns embedded within textual data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project endeavors to identify and categorize emotional sentiments expressed in text, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis, mood detection, and emotion-driven content recommendation systems.

The Emotive Text Analytics Project integrates a combination of machine learning techniques and libraries to analyze textual data for emotional content. It leverages Neattext for preprocessing, Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for implementing various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), Random Forest, Decision Trees, CountVectorizer, and Gradient Boosting. Among these, Logistic Regression stands out for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, making it the preferred choice for sentiment analysis tasks.

The project also features a Streamlit application that allows users to input sentences for sentiment prediction. Upon input, the application predicts the sentiment and its probability, and then generates a graphical representation using Seaborn, plotting emotions against their respective probabilities. This user-friendly interface streamlines the process of analyzing emotional content within text, providing valuable insights with ease.
